I have decided to move my public Git repositories to [GitHub](https://github.com/peklaiho) from *Bitbucket*. There is no denying it: GitHub is the place to be if you want to have a public profile as a software engineer. I have had my code hosted on Bitbucket for years and have been kind of waiting that it would be developed more to be a serious competitor for GitHub. But while Atlassian is a great company in my opinion, their focus seems to be on serving enterprise customers, rather than helping individual developers to have a public profile for their code that looks attractive. GitHub just *looks good*. Bitbucket kind of gets the job done in terms of storing your code, but the appearance does not give you confidence in sharing the links to your repositories with others.

In addition to being visually pleasing, GitHub also has some useful features. For example, it is nice that Issues is an integrated feature where everyone can post bug reports. The security features are also particularly nice. They automatically scan your repositories for passwords or API keys that have been accidentally committed to Git. There is something called the [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) that automatically notifies you if one of your dependencies has a security vulnerability. Keeping track of vulnerabilities is very difficult and time consuming for developers, so that is just an awesome feature in my opinion.

Another interesting code hosting site that seems to be gaining popularity among hackers is [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/). It seems popular with people who don't like Microsoft (the owner of GitHub), or "big tech" in general. Useful to keep in mind as an alternative in case GitHub fails as a responsible company for storing code for open source developers.

In any case, from now all my public code is found on GitHub. Go take a peek.
