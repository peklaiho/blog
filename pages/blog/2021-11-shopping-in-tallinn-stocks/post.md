Shopping is fun in general but shopping for shares of quality companies is *really fun*. The dividend payments that they provide are a good source of funds for other types of shopping such as clothes or luxury items. So far my investing efforts have been mainly focused on Finland and US based companies. I have previously written about [stocks in Helsinki](/blog/2017-12-finding-quality-stocks-in-helsinki/) to provide some ideas for investments. While I want to keep those countries as the biggest weights in my portfolio, I am also exploring other markets for smaller additional positions. In this post I will take a look at Estonia.

The reason why I am interested in Estonia is that my personal company is located there and I am also considering living there in the future. I believe that if I regularly use the products or services of a company, I should be a shareholder as well, as I [wrote before](/blog/2020-03-own-the-companies-you-use/). Thus for me, living in Estonia would also mean being an investor in some of their key companies that I use frequently. Additionally, Estonia appears to be very business- and investment-friendly as far as their politics go which is a big factor for me. Also it is located near Finland so visiting family would be very convenient.

The equity market of Estonia is very small and illiquid which is definitely a negative factor. The lack of liquidity means that not many shares are traded daily but it is not very important from the perspective of a long-term buy-and-hold investor. While Estonia has produced many technology companies with much success, such as Skype and [Wise](https://wise.com/) for example, they have not been listed on their domestic exchange. I hope this trend will change in the future.

## LHV Group

[LHV Group](https://investor.lhv.ee/en/) is currently the most valuable listed company in Estonia. They are focused on banking and financial services. Their share price has had amazing performance this year, tripling from about 15 € to about 45 € as I write this. They also have a presence in the UK. I use LHV for the banking needs of my personal company as well. They offer commission-free trading of Baltic equities but their trading fees for other markets are very high.

> LHV Group is the largest domestic financial group and capital provider in Estonia. LHV Group’s key subsidiaries are LHV Pank, LHV Varahaldus, and LHV Kindlustus. LHV employs over 620 people.

Hopefully this post gives a good overview of the largest publicly traded Estonian companies. As we can see, there are not many choices and the size of the companies drops below 100 M€ in market capitalization after the listed names. However there are still some interesting possibilities among them. I particularly like Kaubamaja Grupp because retail sales tends to be very stable business that is not too affected by economic cycles. After all, we need to eat every day.
