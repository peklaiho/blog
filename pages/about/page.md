# About Me

Here are some links to the companies and projects I am associated with.

I am a partner and board member in [Eneroc Oy](https://www.eneroc.com/en/), a software and technology company located in Turku, Finland. We have developed the [Ajas](https://www.ajas.fi/) software suite targeted for small business users.

My personal company Laiho Consulting OÃœ is located in Tallinn, Estonia through which I provide professional services as a freelancer.

## Contact

The best way to contact me is by email: **pekka.i.laiho** (at) **gmail.com**

## Projects

I have also developed some personal projects:

* [DGI tool](https://dgitool.com/) &mdash; Tool for analyzing dividend stock portfolios
* [MadLisp](https://madlisp.com/) &mdash; Programming language in style of Lisp
* [Stagger](https://github.com/peklaiho/stagger) &mdash; Static website generator, used to make this site

See my [GitHub](https://github.com/peklaiho) for more.

## Programming Languages

The programming languages that I prefer to use:

* C, C++
* C#, F#
* Go
* Lisp (Clojure, Scheme, etc.)
* PHP
* Zig

This represents the languages that I enjoy the most to write and feel the most productive to work with. I am primarily looking for job opportunities in these languages.

I am constantly learning and researching new languages, technologies, frameworks and best practices of the industry. I strongly believe that learning should be a never-ending journey and we should push ourselves every day to increase our skills and knowledge.

## Setup

Supposedly you can know a lot about a person based on what tools they use. So it may be relevant to list my computing setup here. All the parts are hand-picked and customized. I have been running this setup for a few years now so I am very happy with how everything works together.

* OS: [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
* Editor: [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* Window manager: [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)
* Terminal: [st](https://st.suckless.org/)
* Shell: [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

## Website Facts

Some facts about this website:

* Does not use JavaScript
* Does not use cookies or show annoying popups to accept cookies
* Does not have advertisements
* Does not track you or store your personal information

With the web increasingly dominated by ads, tracking, popups and distractions, this is my attempt in making a clean website focused on content.

With the exception of [one poem](/blog/2023-08-poem-about-emacs-and-vim/), the website does not have AI/LLM generated content. All content is written by me.
