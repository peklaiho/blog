Welcome to my website.

My name is Pekka Laiho and I am a backend-focused software engineer by profession. I am also very interested in finance and investing as a hobby. This website is mostly about my [blog](/blog/) and my writings related to these subjects which I am passionate about.

I am always looking for interesting projects to work on so please [contact](/about/) me if I can be of service.

I am currently living in Turku, Finland and have lived 4 years in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
